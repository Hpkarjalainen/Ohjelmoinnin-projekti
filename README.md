# Speed radar

This Arduino-based project utilizes IR sensors to detect motion and calculate speed. It employs two sensors spaced 10cm apart to measure the time difference when triggered, allowing the determination of an object's speed passing between them. The system displays the calculated speed on an LCD screen and activates a buzzer if the speed exceeds 50 cm/sec. It's a simple speed detection setup suitable for monitoring motion in a controlled environment, displaying real-time speed measurements using Arduino and various peripherals.
